# Browse CSV

A little and very simple Flask app to browse the contents of a csv file. I
developed it to read the contents of a spreadsheet (exported to csv) more
comfortably, and to learn some Flask in the process.

# What does it do?

Not much. Displays the contents, let you browse sequentially through them, and
vote the entry. In that way, you can have a summary of what entries are
interesting to you.

# Status

I developed this mainly to learn, and it is bland, rough, and inefficient. It
lacks tests and a proper setup. I might continue working on it or not.

# How to run it

Install the dependencies, and run `start_app.sh`. The app should be available at
<http://localhost:5000>. Press `CTRL+C` to quit.

If you run it like this, a folder named `instance` should appear with a copy of
your data, and your decisions about the entries.
